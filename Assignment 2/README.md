## QUESTION ONE: Explain the difference between programming and software construction using one real-world example

**Programming as an Individual Activity**

Programming is primarily an individual-focused activity where a single programmer is responsible for writing, testing and debugging a specific piece of code. The programmer works independently, concentrating on logic, syntax and correctness of the solution. Decision making is localized meaning the individual decides how to implement the solution without needing extensive coordination with others.

While

**Software Construction as a Team Based Activity**

Software construction is a collaborative and team oriented process that involves multiple professionals working together to develop a complete software system. It goes beyond writing code to include planning, architectural design, integration, testing, documentation and maintenance. This is because no single person can efficiently handle all these responsibilities, teamwork and communication are essential.

**Real world example**

For example the development of a university student management system.

Programming is when a developer writes a specific feature, such as a login module that checks usernames and passwords, or a function that calculates a student’s GPA. The programmer focuses on making sure that this piece of code works correctly on its own. There is no collaboration involved.

Software construction is the overall process of building the entire student management system. It involves designing the system architecture, creating databases, developing frontend interfaces, integrating all modules (registration, grading, finance, login), testing the whole system, documenting it, and deploying it for use. Multiple people such as frontend developers, backend developers, database administrators, testers, and project managers collaborate to deliver the complete system.


## QUESTION TWO: Describe a situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems

Poor maintainability becomes dangerous when a system is hard to understand, hard to modify, and risky to fix, especially in environments where failures affect safety, money, or essential services.

For example on the 19th July 2024, a faulty software update distributed by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused millions of computers running Microsoft Windows to crash worldwide.The update affected a low-level security component that loads very early when a computer starts. Because of an error inside this update, many systems entered a continuous reboot loop and became unusable without manual technical intervention.

This affected hospitals, banks, government services, and especially airlines. Several major airlines were forced to ground flights, halt check-in services, and revert to manual procedures.

This shows how poor maintainability and heavy complexity can turn a routine update into a global crisis

Another example is the British Airway crisis of 2017 where an airline had to cancel hundreds of flights because of a failure in an aging IT infrustructure. In this infrastructure many core applications depended on each other, the failure of one part of the system cascaded into multiple other services. Engineers were unable to isolate the problem easily or bring systems back online.

## QUESTION THREE: Explain why version control is critical in team-based software development
Version control is very critical in team-based software development because it acts like a shared memory and safety net for the entire team. When multiple developers work on the same codebase, version control systems such as Git ensure that everyone’s changes are tracked, organized, and merged in a controlled way. Instead of files being overwritten or lost, each change is recorded with who made it, when, and why, creating accountability and clarity.

It also enables smooth collaboration. Developers can work on different features or fixes at the same time using branches, without interfering with each other’s work. These branches can later be reviewed, tested, and merged into the main codebase, reducing conflicts and improving code quality. If something breaks, version control allows the team to roll back to a previous stable version rather than scrambling to fix everything blindly.

Finally, version control supports learning, stability, and growth. It provides a historical timeline of the project, making it easier for new team members to understand how the software evolved and why certain decisions were made.

## QUESTION FOUR:Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and improve developer skills
Code reviews are contributions made to one's code by his or her peers in effors of improve code quality and correct errors or bugs. This involves peers going through the code, proposing improvements, and ask questions through comments in the pull request. 

This improves software qaulity by ensuring that all code is examined against company or project guidelines and requirements. By doing this, it is certain that no changes merged to the main branch are below standard. 

On the other hand, it improves a developer's skills by enabling them learn from their peers suggested improvements. Senior devs can suggest important changes that a junior dev didn't know about. So in the process, developers learn from their mistakes and their peers. It could be as simple as better programming logic, or reducing time complexity, or fixing an unseen bug that would cause problems later on. In conclusion this breads an effective and efficient software construction pipeline.

## QUESTION FIVE: Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning
Artificial Intelligence can support understanding code by acting as a smart assistant that explains logic, highlights patterns and helps debug errors making complex software concepts more approachable. Instead of replacing learning, it reinforces it by allowing developers to ask why code works, compare different approaches and explore best practices. In software construction and collaboration, Artificial Intelligence can improve productivity by clarifying unfamiliar codebases, generating documentation and suggesting improvements while the real learning still comes from human reasoning, design decisions, teamwork and hands-on problem-solving.
