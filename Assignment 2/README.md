## QUESTION THREE:
Version control is very critical in team-based software development because it acts like a shared memory and safety net for the entire team. When multiple developers work on the same codebase, version control systems such as Git ensure that everyone’s changes are tracked, organized, and merged in a controlled way. Instead of files being overwritten or lost, each change is recorded with who made it, when, and why, creating accountability and clarity.

It also enables smooth collaboration. Developers can work on different features or fixes at the same time using branches, without interfering with each other’s work. These branches can later be reviewed, tested, and merged into the main codebase, reducing conflicts and improving code quality. If something breaks, version control allows the team to roll back to a previous stable version rather than scrambling to fix everything blindly.

Finally, version control supports learning, stability, and growth. It provides a historical timeline of the project, making it easier for new team members to understand how the software evolved and why certain decisions were made.



## QUESTION FIVE:
Artificial Intelligence can support understanding code by acting as a smart assistant that explains logic, highlights patterns and helps debug errors making complex software concepts more approachable. Instead of replacing learning, it reinforces it by allowing developers to ask why code works, compare different approaches and explore best practices. In software construction and collaboration, Artificial Intelligence can improve productivity by clarifying unfamiliar codebases, generating documentation and suggesting improvements while the real learning still comes from human reasoning, design decisions, teamwork and hands-on problem-solving.
