## QUESTION ONE:Explain the difference between programming and software construction using one real-world example
Difference Between Programming and Software Construction
1. **Programming as an Individual Activity**
Programming is primarily an individual-focused activity where a single programmer is responsible for writing, testing and debugging a specific piece of code. The programmer works independently, concentrating on logic, syntax and correctness of the solution. Decision making is localized meaning the individual decides how to implement the solution without needing extensive coordination with others.
Real world example
In the process of building a house, programming is similar to one skilled worker assigned a specific task such as an electrician wiring a single room. The electrician works alone follows a predefined plan and ensures that the wiring functions correctly within that room. While the task is important it does not involve overseeing the entire house or coordinating all other workers. Likewise a programmer may write a login function or a calculation module independently ensuring it works correctly without managing the full software system.
While
**Software Construction as a Team Based Activity**
Software construction is a collaborative and team oriented process that involves multiple professionals working together to develop a complete software system. It goes beyond writing code to include planning, architectural design, integration, testing, documentation and maintenance. This is because no single person can efficiently handle all these responsibilities, teamwork and communication are essential.
Real world example 
Software construction is comparable to constructing an entire house using a team of specialists. Architects design the structure, builders construct the walls, electricians install wiring, plumbers handle water systems, and inspectors ensure safety standards are met. Each worker contributes a part, but the house only becomes functional when all components are properly integrated. Similarly, in software construction, frontend developers, backend developers, database administrators, testers, and project managers work together to deliver a reliable and complete application.

2.**Programming focuses on code correctness**
Programming is mainly concerned with whether a piece of code runs correctly and produces the expected output. Once the code works, the programmer’s task is often considered complete.
Real world example
Programming is like installing a door that opens and closes properly. The task is successful once the door functions as intended. 
While
**Software construction emphasizes overall system quality and long-term sustainability.**
Software construction considers broader quality attributes such as maintainability, scalability, security, performance and ease of future updates. These qualities ensure that the software remains useful and reliable over time.
Real world example:
Software construction is like designing the house so it can withstand weather allow future renovations and remain safe for many years. This involves choosing durable materials following building standards and planning for future expansion.
Software construction also ensures that even after deployment, the system can be maintained, upgraded, and scaled without breaking.

## QUESTION TWO: Describe a situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems

## QUESTION THREE: Explain why version control is critical in team-based software development
Version control is very critical in team-based software development because it acts like a shared memory and safety net for the entire team. When multiple developers work on the same codebase, version control systems such as Git ensure that everyone’s changes are tracked, organized, and merged in a controlled way. Instead of files being overwritten or lost, each change is recorded with who made it, when, and why, creating accountability and clarity.

It also enables smooth collaboration. Developers can work on different features or fixes at the same time using branches, without interfering with each other’s work. These branches can later be reviewed, tested, and merged into the main codebase, reducing conflicts and improving code quality. If something breaks, version control allows the team to roll back to a previous stable version rather than scrambling to fix everything blindly.

Finally, version control supports learning, stability, and growth. It provides a historical timeline of the project, making it easier for new team members to understand how the software evolved and why certain decisions were made.

## QUESTION FOUR:Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and improve developer skills
Code reviews are contributions made to one's code by his or her peers in effors of improve code quality and correct errors or bugs. This involves peers going through the code, proposing improvements, and ask questions through comments in the pull request. 

This improves software qaulity by ensuring that all code is examined against company or project guidelines and requirements. By doing this, it is certain that no changes merged to the main branch are below standard. 

On the other hand, it improves a developer's skills by enabling them learn from their peers suggested improvements. Senior devs can suggest important changes that a junior dev didn't know about. So in the process, developers learn from their mistakes and their peers. It could be as simple as better programming logic, or reducing time complexity, or fixing an unseen bug that would cause problems later on. In conclusion this breads an effective and efficient software construction pipeline.

## QUESTION FIVE: Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning
Artificial Intelligence can support understanding code by acting as a smart assistant that explains logic, highlights patterns and helps debug errors making complex software concepts more approachable. Instead of replacing learning, it reinforces it by allowing developers to ask why code works, compare different approaches and explore best practices. In software construction and collaboration, Artificial Intelligence can improve productivity by clarifying unfamiliar codebases, generating documentation and suggesting improvements while the real learning still comes from human reasoning, design decisions, teamwork and hands-on problem-solving.
